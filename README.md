# Import movie, sound and image files into the Blender Asset Browser

## Why?
By importing source material into the Asset Browser, you can use the catalog and tag functions to organize it, and then drag it into the VSE.  

## How?
To get it working, you'll need use Blender 3.4+ beta and to go to Preferences > Interface > Developer Extras and enable it. And then enable Preferences > Experimental > Extented Asset Browser.

You'll find the function exposed in the Sequencer > Menus > Add > Import as Asset.
